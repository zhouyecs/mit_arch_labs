Write your answer to this question in the text file discussion.txt provided in the lab repository.

1, What is the source of the performance gap between your two elastic implementations (when it is using the class fifo and when it is using your own fifo)?

whether the fifo can implement enq and deq concurrently or not.

2, Assume you are given a black box module that performs a 10-stage algorithm. You can not look at its internal implementation, but you can test this module 
by giving it data and looking at the output of the module. You have been told that it is implemented as one of the structures covered in this lab, but you 
do not know which one. How can you tell if it is inelastic or if it is elastic? 

insert a bubble, and check the output.
If it is inelastic, the output data will be correct, else it will be wrong.


3, How long did you take to work on this lab?
