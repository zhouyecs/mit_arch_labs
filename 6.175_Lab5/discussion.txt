1. What is the IPC for the two-stage pipelined processor for each benchmark tested by the run_bmarks.sh script?

Benchmark vvadd
Cycles = 3005
Insts  = 2408
IPC    = 0.80

Benchmark tower
Cycles = 4513
Insts  = 4168
IPC    = 0.92

Benchmark qsort
Cycles = 168377
Insts  = 123496
IPC    = 0.73

Benchmark multiply
Cycles = 27007
Insts  = 20893
IPC    = 0.77

Benchmark median
Cycles = 5930
Insts  = 4243
IPC    = 0.71

2. What is the formula to compute the next address predictor accuracy from the IPC? (Hint, how many cycles does it take to execute an instruction when the PC+4 prediction is correct? What about when it is incorrect?) Using this formula, what is the accuracy of the PC+4 next address predictor for each benchmark?

accuracy = 2 - 1 / ipc

Benchmark vvadd
IPC      = 0.80
accuracy = 0.75

Benchmark tower
IPC      = 0.92
accuracy = 0.91

Benchmark qsort
IPC      = 0.73
accuracy = 0.63

Benchmark multiply
IPC      = 0.77
accuracy = 0.70

Benchmark median
IPC      = 0.71
accuracy = 0.59

3. What is the IPC for the two-stage pipelined processor with a BTB for each benchmark tested by the run_bmarks.sh script? How much has it improved over the previous version?

Benchmark vvadd
Cycles = 2411
Insts  = 2408
IPC    = 0.999

Benchmark tower
Cycles = 4359
Insts  = 4168
IPC    = 0.956

Benchmark qsort
Cycles = 155349
Insts  = 123496
IPC    = 0.795

Benchmark multiply
Cycles = 22070
Insts  = 20893
IPC    = 0.947

Benchmark median
Cycles = 4359
Insts  = 4168
IPC    = 0.956

excep qsort, others improved much

4. How does adding the BTB change the performance of the bpred_* microbenchmarks? (Hint: the number of cycles for bpred_j should go down.)

bpred_j
Cycles = 3506
Insts  = 1806

bpred_bht
Cycles = 1210
Insts  = 1010

bpred_ras
Cycles = 413
Insts  = 286
