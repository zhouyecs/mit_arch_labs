1. Describe your design of the mkPitchAdjust module. How many cycles does it take to do a
single round of pitch adjustment in your design?



2. Describe your design of the ToMP and FromMP modules. How many cycles does it take to convert
a Vector of N Complex numbers to a Vector of N ComplexMP numbers assuming it takes K
cycles to convert a single number?



3. What portion of your time in this lab was spent initially implementing the mkPitchAdjust
module and completing the pipeline, and what portion of your time was spent designing and
implementing tests and debugging the pipeline?



4. Report the synthesis result (i.e., area and critical path) of your mkAudioPipeline module.
The report also shows you where the critical path starts and ends. Can you figure out which
module accounts for the critical path?
